%   weightMatrix  - the weight matrix. weightMatrix(:, c) is the cth basis

%   featureMatrix - the feature matrix. featureMatrix(:, c) is the features
%                   for the cth example
%   visibleSize   - number of pixels in the patches
%   numFeatures   - number of features
%   patches       - patches
